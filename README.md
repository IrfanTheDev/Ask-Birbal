# Ask Birbal.
"Ask Birbal" is a Quora-like question-answer and social network website for asking question, getting answers and following users.

## Overview
Ask Birbal is my final project for Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.
Birbal was one of the nine famous advisor in the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar. He was famous for his wit.
Ask birbal is a website that allows users to ask questions and any users who know the answer can answer the question.

When you arrive at the homepage of this website, after login, you can start by writing your question and click on the ask button. The question will be submitted then and can be viewed on the main page of the site. Now if someone else have same or similar question then they can bookmark that question to increase it's intensity and to save it in the bookmarked section, so that if that question recieved answer then they can also get it quickly without losting in collection of all the question. 

One can answer the question by clicking on the answer button or on the question itself, which will take them on a different page specific to that question, where they can see other answer written by other users. Here they can write answers in the text editor which give feature to customazie the text as bold, italicized, underlined, different font-sizes, different font-family, highlighting colors, they can even add link to other resoursec too. After posting the answer, the answer can be viewed on that page.

If you  consider any answer helpful then  There is interactive button too for the answers "helpful" which also show how many user consider this answer helpful. There are two other interactive button Like and Bookmarked are also present but for the questions only.  <br/>
